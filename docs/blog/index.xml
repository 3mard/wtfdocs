      <title>Monochrome Retro Display</title>

      <description>November 10, 2019 With v0.24.0, WTF now has better support for theme-like colour settings. It&amp;rsquo;s far from perfect, a lot of modules will have to be improved internally to make theming ubiquitous, but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.
By way of example, if you&amp;rsquo;re running v0.24 or later, drop this into your config at the top, replace your existing colors: YAML block with the following and you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a facsimile of an old-school green monochrome monitor display (you may need to restart WTF to get changes to take effect).</description>

      <description>July 12, 2019 As of today WTF can be installed on macOS using Homebrew:
brew tap wtfutil/wtfutil brew install wtfutil wtfutil If everything goes according to plan, you should now find wtfutil on your system as an executable binary:
‚ùØ which wtfutil /usr/local/bin/wtfutil‚ùØ ls /usr/local/bin/wtfutil lrwxr-xr-x 1 xxxxxx admin 36 11 Jul 17:29 /usr/local/bin/wtfutil - .</description>

      <title>Binary Renamed to &#39;wtfutil&#39;</title>
      <link>https://wtfutil.com/blog/2019-07-10-wtfutil-release/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 10:09:34 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wtfutil.com/blog/2019-07-10-wtfutil-release/</guid>
      <description>July 10, 2019 With the release of v0.15.0, the installed binary has been renamed from wtf to wtfutil.
To execute it, you must now use:
wtfutil The name has changed because calling it wtf caused a collision with the venerable and amusing bsd-wtf utility. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem back when there was only one person using WTF and no one else knew about it, but with the rise in popularity this collision has been causing problems for some people.</description>
