      <title>Binary Renamed to &#39;wtfutil&#39;</title>
      <link>https://wtfutil.com/blog/2019-07-10-wtfutil-release/</link>

      <guid>https://wtfutil.com/blog/2019-07-10-wtfutil-release/</guid>
      <description>July 10, 2019 With the release of v0.15.0, the installed binary has been renamed from wtf to wtfutil.
To execute it, you must now use:
wtfutil The name has changed because calling it wtf caused a collision with the venerable and amusing bsd-wtf utility. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem back when there was only one person using WTF and no one else knew about it, but with the rise in popularity this collision has been causing problems for some people.</description>
