With the release of [v0.15.0](https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf/releases/tag/v0.15.0), the installed binary has been renamed from `wtf` to `wtfutil`.

This is because the name `wtf` collided with the venerable and amusing [bsd-wtf](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bsdwtf/) utility, installable via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), and that collision was causing some people some problems.

Given that `bsd-wtf` was created long before WTF, it seemed only proper to abdicate the name.
